This small project is still being developed.

Use `npm run dev` to run both front- and back-end. Flashcards app will start automatically at localhost:3000 with server running at localhost:5000.
To avoid connecting to database at this point, all data is stored in src/data/flashcards.json and src/data/user.json files with example flashcards and dummy user data.
